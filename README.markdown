Tmux Vim Syntax
===============

Syntax file for Tmux configuration in Vim. Forked from [zaiste's
repository][1], itself a mirror of the file by [Tiago Cunha][2] included in the
Tmux source distribution, in the `examples` directory.

This way I can add it as a Pathogen bundle and submodule of my [dotfiles][3]
repository. This was forked to add some extra `ftdetect` rules and make
a couple of other fixes.
